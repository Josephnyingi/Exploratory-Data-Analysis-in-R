# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-in-R
This repository demonstrates concepts exploratory data analysis in R.
# Project Description
Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis are important basic steps in the data pipeline process of any data science project. Data cleaning allows us to prepare the data appropriately and involves dealing with missing values, anomalies, outliers, duplicate data among other steps. Exploratory data analysis allow us to learn more about the variables in the data. Insights from EDA can later inform decisions on data modelling or prediction.

For this analysis, the goal is to prepare advertisement related data and use insights from EDA to identify individuals who are most likely to click on a cryptography course advertisement. The data used for the analysis was collected from a prior advertisement for a similar course on the same platform. The dataset contains 10 attributes and 1,000 records. These attributes contain descriptive information of past blog users. Some of the attributes include country, age and gender of the user among others.
